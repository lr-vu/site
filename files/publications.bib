	abstract = {It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the 2018 International Workshop on Learning Representations for Big Networks (BigNet@WWW2018). This is the third edition of the BigNet workshop series, following its inauguration at the 25th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM 2016) and the second edition at the 26th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW 2017). Recent years have witnessed the emergence of network representation learning research. Different from the feature engineering process in conventional analysis, network representation learning, also know as network embedding, aims to learn the latent low-dimensional representations for objects in networks, such as nodes, links, and groups. Its ultimate objective is to encode networks' structural properties into the latent representations, benefiting all existing network mining tasks, such as node classification, link prediction, community detection, etc. In the BigNet 2018 workshop, we aim to provide a forum for presenting the most recent advances in network representation learning to unearth rich knowledge.},

	abstract = {While Knowledge Graphs (KG) are graph shaped by nature, most traditional data mining and machine learning (ML) software expect data in a vector form. Several node embedding techniques have been proposed to represent each node in the KG as a low-dimensional feature vector. A node embedding technique should preferably be task independent. Therefore, when a new method has been developed, it should be tested on the tasks it was designed for as well as on other tasks. We present the design and implementation of a ready to use evaluation framework to simplify the node embedding technique testing phase. The provided tests range from ML tasks, semantic tasks to semantic analogies.},
