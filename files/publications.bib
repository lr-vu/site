	abstract = {In this article, we provide a comprehensive introduction to knowledge graphs, which have recently garnered significant attention from both industry and academia in scenarios that require exploiting diverse, dynamic, large-scale collections of data. After some opening remarks, we motivate and contrast various graph-based data models, as well as languages used to query and validate knowledge graphs. We explain how knowledge can be represented and extracted using a combination of deductive and inductive techniques. We conclude with high-level future research directions for knowledge graphs.},

	url = {https://openreview.net/forum?id=PoAI5RrlUFj},
	abstract = {Shared vocabularies and ontologies are essential for many applications. Although standards and recommendations already cover many areas, adaptations are usually necessary to represent concrete use-cases properly. Domain experts are unfamiliar with ontology engineering, which creates special requirements for needed tool support. Simple sketch applications are usually too imprecise, while comprehensive ontology editors are often too complicated for non-experts. We present Neologism 2.0 – an open-source tool for quick vocabulary creation through domain experts. Its guided vocabulary creation and its collaborative graph editor enable the quick creation of proper vocabularies, even for non-experts, and dramatically reduces the time and effort to draft vocabularies collaboratively. An RDF export allows quick bootstrapping of any other Semantic Web tool.},
