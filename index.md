    {% comment %}
    News items are one or two sentences long, ideally containing a link to more information. They include:
    - Any new member of the group
    - Journal/conference papers we would like to highlight (generally at acceptance). We don't have to have a news item for
      all papers.
    - Group members are referred to by first name, unless they're being introduced.
    - Only the subject of the news message gets a link.
