- abstract: In this article, we provide a comprehensive introduction to
    knowledge graphs, which have recently garnered significant attention
    from both industry and academia in scenarios that require exploiting
    diverse, dynamic, large-scale collections of data. After some
    opening remarks, we motivate and contrast various graph-based data
    models, as well as languages used to query and validate knowledge
    graphs. We explain how knowledge can be represented and extracted
    using a combination of deductive and inductive techniques. We
    conclude with high-level future research directions for knowledge
    graphs.

- abstract: Shared vocabularies and ontologies are essential for many
    applications. Although standards and recommendations already cover
    many areas, adaptations are usually necessary to represent concrete
    use-cases properly. Domain experts are unfamiliar with ontology
    engineering, which creates special requirements for needed tool
    support. Simple sketch applications are usually too imprecise, while
    comprehensive ontology editors are often too complicated for
    non-experts. We present Neologism 2.0 -- an open-source tool for
    quick vocabulary creation through domain experts. Its guided
    vocabulary creation and its collaborative graph editor enable the
    quick creation of proper vocabularies, even for non-experts, and
    dramatically reduces the time and effort to draft vocabularies
    collaboratively. An RDF export allows quick bootstrapping of any
    other Semantic Web tool.
