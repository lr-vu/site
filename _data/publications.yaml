        abstractNote: In line with the general trend in artificial intelligence research
            to create intelligent systems that combine learning and symbolic components,
            a new sub-area has emerged that focuses on combining Machine Learning
            components with techniques developed by the Semantic Web community—Semantic
            Web Machine Learning (SWeML). Due to its rapid growth and impact on several
            communities in thepast two decades, there is a need to better understand
            the space of these SWeML Systems, their characteristics, and trends. Yet,
            surveys that adopt principled and unbiased approaches are missing. To
            fill this gap, we performed a systematic study and analyzed nearly 500
            papers published in the past decade in this area, where we focused on
            evaluating architectural and application-specific features. Our analysis
            identified a rapidly growing interest in SWeML Systems, with a high impact
            on several application domains and tasks. Catalysts for this rapid growth
            are the increased application of deep learning and knowledge graph technologies.
            By leveraging the in-depth understanding of this area acquired through
            this study, a further key contribution of this article is a classification
            system for SWeML Systems that we publish as ontology.

        abstractNote: Causal discovery is a major task with the utmost importance
            for machine learning since causal structures can enable models to go beyond
            pure correlation-based inference and significantly boost their performance.
            However, finding causal structures from data poses a significant challenge
            both in computational effort and accuracy, let alone its impossibility
            without interventions in general. In this paper, we develop a meta-reinforcement
            learning algorithm that performs causal discovery by learning to perform
            interventions such that it can construct an explicit causal graph. Apart
            from being useful for possible downstream applications, the estimated
            causal graph also provides an explanation for the data-generating process.
            In this article, we show that our algorithm estimates a good graph compared
            to the SOTA approaches, even in environments whose underlying causal structure
            is previously unseen. Further, we make an ablation study that shows how
            learning interventions contribute to the overall performance of our approach.
            We conclude that interventions indeed help boost the performance, efficiently
            yielding an accurate estimate of the causal structure of a possibly unseen
            environment.

        abstractNote: We propose a method that allows to develop shared understanding
            between two agents for the purpose of performing a task that requires
            cooperation. Our method focuses on efficiently establishing successful
            task-oriented communication in an open multi-agent system, where the agents
            do not know anything about each other and can only communicate via grounded
            interaction. The method aims to assist researchers that work on human-machine
            interaction or scenarios that require a human-in-the-loop, by defining
            interaction restrictions and efficiency metrics. To that end, we point
            out the challenges and limitations of such a (diverse) setup, while also
            restrictions and requirements which aim to ensure that high task performance
            truthfully reflects the extent to which the agents correctly understand
            each other. Furthermore, we demonstrate a use-case where our method can
            be applied for the task of cooperative query answering. We design the
            experiments by modifying an established ontology alignment benchmark.
            In this example, the agents want to query each other, while representing
            different databases, defined in their own ontologies that contain different
            and incomplete knowledge. Grounded interaction here has the form of examples
            that consists of common instances, for which the agents are expected to
            have similar knowledge. Our experiments demonstrate successful communication
            establishment under the required restrictions, and compare different agent
            policies that aim to solve the task in an efficient manner.

        abstractNote: Inspired by the cognitive science theory of the explicit human
            memory systems, we have modeled an agent with short-term, episodic, and
            semantic memory systems, each of which is modeled with a knowledge graph.
            To evaluate this system and analyze the behavior of this agent, we designed
            and released our own reinforcement learning agent environment, “the Room”,
            where an agent has to learn how to encode, store, and retrieve memories
            to maximize its return by answering questions. We show that our deep Q-learning
            based agent successfully learns whether a short-term memory should be
            forgotten, or rather be stored in the episodic or semantic memory systems.
            Our experiments indicate that an agent with human-like memory systems
            can outperform an agent without this memory structure in the environment.

        abstractNote: Large-scale, algorithmic access to LOD Cloud data has been hampered
            by the absence of queryable endpoints for many datasets, a plethora of
            serialization formats, and an abundance of idiosyncrasies such as syntax
            errors. As of late, very large-scale - hundreds of thousands of document,
            tens of billions of triples - access to RDF data has become possible thanks
            to the LOD Laundromat Web Service. In this paper we showcase Frank, a
            command-line interface to a very large collection of standards-compliant,
            real-world RDF data that can be used to run Semantic Web experiments and
            stress-test Linked Data applications.

        abstractNote: Recent work has shown learning systems can use logical background
            knowledge to compensate for a lack of labeled training data. Many methods
            work by creating a loss function that encodes this knowledge. However,
            often the logic is discarded after training, even if it is still helpful
            at test time. Instead, we ensure neural network predictions satisfy the
            knowledge by refining the predictions with an extra computation step.
            We introduce differentiable refinement functions that find a corrected
            prediction close to the original prediction. We study how to effectively
            and efficiently compute these refinement functions. Using a new algorithm
            called iterative local refinement (ILR), we combine refinement functions
            to find refined predictions for logical formulas of any complexity. ILR
            finds refinements on complex SAT formulas in significantly fewer iterations
            and frequently finds solutions where gradient descent can not. Finally,
            ILR produces competitive results in the MNIST addition task.

        abstractNote: The exponential growth in the ability to generate, capture,
            and store high dimensional data has driven sophisticated machine learning
            applications. However, high dimensionality often poses a challenge for
            analysts to effectively identify and extract relevant features from datasets.
            Though many feature selection methods have shown good results in supervised
            learning, the major challenge lies in the area of unsupervised feature
            selection. For example, in the domain of data visualization, high-dimensional
            data is difficult to visualize and interpret due to the limitations of
            the screen, resulting in visual clutter. Visualizations are more interpretable
            when visualized in a low dimensional feature space. To mitigate these
            challenges, we present an approach to perform unsupervised feature clustering
            and selection using our novel graph clustering algorithm based on Clique-Cover
            Theory. We implemented our approach in an interactive data exploration
            tool which facilitates the exploration of relationships between features
            and generates interpretable visualizations.

        abstractNote: Shared vocabularies and ontologies are essential for many applications.
            Although standards and recommendations already cover many areas, adaptations
            are usually necessary to represent concrete use-cases properly. Domain
            experts are unfamiliar with ontology engineering, which creates special
            requirements for needed tool support. Simple sketch applications are usually
            too imprecise, while comprehensive ontology editors are often too complicated
            for non-experts. We present Neologism 2.0 – an open-source tool for quick
            vocabulary creation through domain experts. Its guided vocabulary creation
            and its collaborative graph editor enable the quick creation of proper
            vocabularies, even for non-experts, and dramatically reduces the time
            and effort to draft vocabularies collaboratively. An RDF export allows
            quick bootstrapping of any other Semantic Web tool.

        ISSN: 0219-3116
        abstractNote: In order to facilitate the accesses of general users to knowledge
            graphs, an increasing effort is being exerted to construct graph-structured
            queries of given natural language questions. At the core of the construction
            is to deduce the structure of the target query and determine the vertices/edges
            which constitute the query. Existing query construction methods rely on
            question understanding and conventional graph-based algorithms which lead
            to inefficient and degraded performances facing complex natural language
            questions over knowledge graphs with large scales. In this paper, we focus
            on this problem and propose a novel framework standing on recent knowledge
            graph embedding techniques. Our framework first encodes the underlying
            knowledge graph into a low-dimensional embedding space by leveraging generalized
            local knowledge graphs. Given a natural language question, the learned
            embedding representations of the knowledge graph are utilized to compute
            the query structure and assemble vertices/edges into the target query.
            Extensive experiments were conducted on the benchmark dataset, and the
            results demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baseline
            models regarding effectiveness and efficiency.

        abstractNote: Wikidata is a free and open knowledge base which can be read
            and edited by both humans and machines. It acts as a central storage for
            the structured data of several Wikimedia projects. To improve the process
            of manually inserting new facts, the Wikidata platform features an association
            rule-based tool to recommend additional suitable properties. In this work,
            we introduce a novel approach to provide such recommendations based on
            frequentist inference. We introduce a trie-based method that can efficiently
            learn and represent property set probabilities in RDF graphs. We extend
            the method by adding type information to improve recommendation precision
            and introduce backoff strategies which further increase the performance
            of the initial approach for entities with rare property combinations.
            We investigate how the captured structure can be employed for property
            recommendation, analogously to the Wikidata PropertySuggester. We evaluate
            our approach on the full Wikidata dataset and compare its performance
            to the state-of-the-art Wikidata PropertySuggester, outperforming it in
            all evaluated metrics. Notably we could reduce the average rank of the
            first relevant recommendation by 71%.

        abstractNote: In this article, we provide a comprehensive introduction to
            knowledge graphs, which have recently garnered significant attention from
            both industry and academia in scenarios that require exploiting diverse,
            dynamic, large-scale collections of data. After some opening remarks,
            we motivate and contrast various graph-based data models, as well as languages
            used to query and validate knowledge graphs. We explain how knowledge
            can be represented and extracted using a combination of deductive and
            inductive techniques. We conclude with high-level future research directions
            for knowledge graphs.

        abstractNote: Training of Relational Graph Convolutional Networks (R-GCN)
            is a memory intense task. The amount of gradient information that needs
            to be stored during training for real-world graphs is often too large
            for the amount of memory available on most GPUs. In this work, we experiment
            with the use of graph summarization techniques to compress the graph and
            hence reduce the amount of memory needed. After training the R-GCN on
            the graph summary, we transfer the weights back to the original graph
            and attempt to perform inference on it. We obtain reasonable results on
            the AIFB, MUTAG and AM datasets. Our experiments show that training on
            the graph summary can yield a comparable or higher accuracy to training
            on the original graphs. Furthermore, if we take the time to compute the
            summary out of the equation, we observe that the smaller graph representations
            obtained with graph summarization methods reduces the computational overhead.
            However, further experiments are needed to evaluate additional graph summary
            models and whether our findings also holds true for very large graphs.

        abstractNote: Large, heterogeneous datasets are characterized by missing or
            even erroneous information. This is more evident when they are the product
            of community effort or automatic fact extraction methods from external
            sources, such as text. A special case of the aforementioned phenomenon
            can be seen in knowledge graphs, where this mostly appears in the form
            of missing or incorrect edges and nodes.

        abstractNote: Knowledge Graphs (KG) are of vital importance for multiple applications
            on the web, including information retrieval, recommender systems, and
            metadata annotation. Regardless of whether they are built manually by
            domain experts or with automatic pipelines, KGs are often incomplete.
            To address this problem, there is a large amount of work that proposes
            using machine learning to complete these graphs by predicting new links.
            Recent work has begun to explore the use of textual descriptions available
            in knowledge graphs to learn vector representations of entities in order
            to preform link prediction. However, the extent to which these representations
            learned for link prediction generalize to other tasks is unclear. This
            is important given the cost of learning such representations. Ideally,
            we would prefer representations that do not need to be trained again when
            transferring to a different task, while retaining reasonable performance.
            Therefore, in this work, we propose a holistic evaluation protocol for
            entity representations learned via a link prediction objective. We consider
            the inductive link prediction and entity classification tasks, which involve
            entities not seen during training. We also consider an information retrieval
            task for entity-oriented search. We evaluate an architecture based on
            a pretrained language model, that exhibits strong generalization to entities
            not observed during training, and outperforms related state-of-the-art
            methods (22% MRR improvement in link prediction on average). We further
            provide evidence that the learned representations transfer well to other
            tasks without fine-tuning. In the entity classification task we obtain
            an average improvement of 16% in accuracy compared with baselines that
            also employ pre-trained models. In the information retrieval task, we
            obtain significant improvements of up to 8.8% in NDCG@10 for natural language
            queries. We thus show that the learned representations are not limited
            KG-specific tasks, and have greater generalization properties than evaluated
            in previous work.

        abstractNote: While RDF data are graph shaped by nature, most traditional
            Machine Learning (ML) algorithms expect data in a vector form. To transform
            graph elements to vectors, several graph embedding approaches have been
            proposed. Comparing these approaches is interesting for 1) developers
            of new embedding techniques to verify in which cases their proposal outperforms
            the state-of-art and 2) consumers of these techniques in choosing the
            best approach according to the task(s) the vectors will be used for. The
            comparison could be delayed (and made difficult) by the choice of tasks,
            the design of the evaluation, the selection of models, parameters, and
            needed datasets. We propose GEval, an evaluation framework to simplify
            the evaluation and the comparison of graph embedding techniques. The covered
            tasks range from ML tasks (Classification, Regression, Clustering), semantic
            tasks (entity relatedness, document similarity) to semantic analogies.
            However, GEval is designed to be (easily) extensible. In this article,
            we will describe the design and development of the proposed framework
            by detailing its overall structure, the already implemented tasks, and
            how to extend it. In conclusion, to demonstrate its operating approach,
            we consider the parameter tuning of the KGloVe algorithm as a use case.

        abstractNote: Background Early diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) is likely
            to reduce burden of disease and improve treatment success. Estimation
            of the individual patient risk for CRC diagnostic determinants in a primary
            care setting has not been very successful as yet. The aim of our study
            is to improve prediction of CRC in patients selected for colonoscopy in
            the primary healthcare setting using readily available routine healthcare
            data. Patients and methods A cross-sectional study was carried out in
            the Julius General Practitioners' Network database. Patients referred
            for colonoscopy by their general practitioner (GP) between 2007 and 2012
            were selected. We evaluated the association between long-term registered
            patient characteristics, symptoms and conditions, and colonoscopy test
            results with multivariable logistic regression. Results Two per cent (2787/140
            000) of the patients between 30 and 85 years were found to be newly referred
            for colonoscopy by their GP, of whom 57 (2%) were diagnosed with CRC.
            Age 50 years or over, hypertension and the absence of preceding consultations
            for abdominal pain were independent predictors for CRC and/or high-risk
            adenomas, with an area under the curve of 0.65. Conclusion Three factors
            in routine care data combined might prove valuable in future strategies
            to improve the prediction of CRC risk in primary care. Improvement in
            quality and availability of routine care data for research and risk stratification
            is needed to optimize its usability for prediction purposes in daily practice.
            Impact Only referring patients at the highest risk for colonoscopy by
            the GP could decrease superfluous colonoscopies.

        abstractNote: In this paper, we describe foxPSL, a fast, optimized and extended
            implementation of Probabilistic Soft Logic (PSL) based on the distributed
            graph processing framework Signal/Collect. PSL is one of the leading formalisms
            of statistical relational learning, a recently developed field of machine
            learning that aims at representing both uncertainty and rich relational
            structures, usually by combining logical representations with probabilistic
            graphical models. PSL can be seen as both a probabilistic logic and a
            template language for hinge-loss Markov Random Fields, a type of continuous
            Markov Random fields (MRF) in which Maximum a Posteriori inference is
            very efficient, since it can be formulated as a constrained convex minimization
            problem, as opposed to a discrete optimization problem for standard MRFs.
            From the logical perspective, a key feature of PSL is the capability to
            represent soft truth values, allowing the expression of complex domain
            knowledge, like degrees of truth, in parallel with uncertainty. foxPSL
            supports the full PSL pipeline from problem definition to a distributed
            solver that implements the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
            (ADMM) consensus optimization. It provides a Domain Specific Language
            that extends standard PSL with a class system and existential quantifiers,
            allowing for efficient grounding. Moreover, it implements a series of
            configurable optimizations, like optimized grounding of constraints and
            lazy inference, that improve grounding and inference time. We perform
            an extensive evaluation, comparing the performance of foxPSL to a state-of-the-art
            implementation of ADMM consensus optimization in GraphLab, and show an
            improvement in both inference time and solution quality. Moreover, we
            evaluate the impact of the optimizations on the execution time and discuss
            the trade-offs related to each optimization.

        abstractNote: Medical guidelines are documents that describe optimal treatment
            for patients by medical practitioners based on current medical research
            (evidence), in the form of step-by-step recommendations. Because the field
            of medical research is very large and always evolving, keeping these guidelines
            up-to-date with the current state of the art is a difficult task. In this
            paper, we propose a method for finding relevant evidence for supporting
            the medical guideline updating process. Our method that takes from the
            evidence-based medical guideline the recommendations and their corresponding
            evidence as its input, and that queries PubMed, the world's largest search
            engine for medical citations, for potential new or improved evidence.
            We built a prototype and performed a feasibility study on a set of old
            recommendations, and compared the output to evidence for the newer version.
            The system succeeded in finding goal articles for 11 out of 16 recommendations,
            but in total, only 20 out of 71 articles were retrieved. Our ranking method
            for most relevant articles worked well for small result sets, but for
            large result sets it failed to rank the goal articles in the top 25 results.

        abstractNote: Recent years have witnessed a growing interest from archaeological
            communities in Linked Data. ARIADNE, the AdvancedResearch Infrastructure
            for Archaeological Data set Networking in Europe, facilitates a central
            web portal that providesaccess to archaeological data from various sources.
            Parts of these data have been being published as Linked Data, andare currently
            available in the Linked Open Data cloud. With it, the nature of these
            data has shifted from unstructuredto structured. This presents new opportunities
            for data mining. In this work, we investigate to what extend data mining
            can contribute to the understanding of linked archaeological data, and
            which form would best meet the communities' needs.

        abstractNote: Patient recruitment is one of the most important barriers to
            successful completion of clinical trials and thus to obtaining evidence
            about new methods for prevention, diagnostics and treatment. The reason
            is that recruitment is effort consuming. It requires the identification
            of candidate patients for the trial (the population under study), and
            verifying for each patient whether the eligibility criteria are met. The
            work we describe in this paper aims to support the comparison of population
            under study in different trials, and the design of eligibility criteria
            for new trials. We do this by introducing structured eligibility criteria,
            that enhance reuse of criteria across trials. We developed a method that
            allows for automated structuring of criteria from text. Additionally,
            structured eligibility criteria allow us to propose suggestions for relaxation
            of criteria to remove potentially unnecessarily restrictive conditions.
            We thereby increase the recruitment potential and generalizability of
            a trial.Our method for automated structuring of criteria enables us to
            identify related conditions and to compare their restrictiveness. The
            comparison is based on the general meaning of criteria, comprised of commonly
            occurring contextual patterns, medical concepts and constraining values.
            These are automatically identified using our pattern detection algorithm,
            state of the art ontology annotators and semantic taggers. The comparison
            uses predefined relations between the patterns, concept equivalences defined
            in medical ontologies, and threshold values. The result is a library of
            structured eligibility criteria which can be browsed using fine grained
            queries. Furthermore, we developed visualizations for the library that
            enable intuitive navigation of relations between trials, criteria and
            concepts. These visualizations expose interesting co-occurrences and correlations,
            potentially enhancing meta-research.The method for criteria structuring
            processes only certain types of criteria, which results in low recall
            of the method (18%) but a high precision for the relations we identify
            between the criteria (94%). Analysis of the approach from the medical
            perspective revealed that the approach can be beneficial for supporting
            trial design, though more research is needed.

        abstractNote: With the increasing popularity of mobile phones, large amounts
            of real and reliable mobile phone data are being generated every day.
            These mobile phone data represent the practical travel routes of users
            and imply the intelligence of them in selecting a suitable route. Usually,
            an experienced user knows which route is congested in a specified period
            of time but unblocked in another period of time. Moreover, a route used
            frequently and recently by a user is usually the suitable one to satisfy
            the user’s needs. Adaptive control of thought-rational (ACT-R) is a computational
            cognitive architecture, which provides a good framework to understand
            the principles and mechanisms of information organization, retrieval and
            selection in human memory. In this paper, we employ ACT-R to model the
            process of selecting a suitable route of users. We propose a cognition-inspired
            route evaluation method to mine the intelligence of users in selecting
            a suitable route, evaluate the suitability of the routes, and then recommend
            an ordered list of routes for subscribers. Experiments show that it is
            effective and feasible to evaluate the suitability of the routes inspired
            by cognition.

        abstractNote: Monitoring systems for the safety of building structure (SBS)
            can provide people with important data related to main supporting points
            in a building and then help people to make a reasonable maintenance schedule.
            However, more and more data bring a challenge for data management and
            data mining. In order to meet this challenge, under the framework of Wisdom
            Web of Things (W2T), we design a monitoring system for the SBS by using
            the semantic and the multisource data fusion technologies. This system
            establishes a dynamical data cycle among the physical world (buildings),
            the social world (humans), and the cyber world (computers) and provides
            various services in the monitoring process to alleviate engineers' workload.
            Furthermore, all data in the cyber world are organized as the raw data,
            the semantic information, and the multisource knowledge. Based on this
            organization, we can concentrate on the data fusion from the viewpoints
            of time, space, and multisensor. At last, a prototype system powered by
            the semantic platform LarKC is tested from the aspects of sample performance
            and time consumption. In particular, noisy data (i.e., inconsistent, abnormal,
            or error data) are detected through the fusion of multisource knowledge,
            and some rule-based reasoning is conducted to provide personalized service.

        abstractNote: While almost all dictionary compression techniques focus on
            static RDF data, we present a compact in-memory RDF dictionary for dynamic
            and streaming data. To do so, we analysed the structure of terms in real-world
            datasets and observed a high degree of common prefixes. We studied the
            applicability of Trie data structures on RDF data to reduce the memory
            occupied by common prefixes and discovered that all existing Trie implementations
            lead to either poor performance, or an excessive memory wastage. In our
            approach, we address the existing limitations of Tries for RDF data, and
            propose a new variant of Trie which contains some optimizations explicitly
            designed to improve the performance on RDF data. Furthermore, we show
            how we use this Trie as an in-memory dictionary by using as numerical
            ID a memory address instead of an integer counter. This design removes
            the need for an additional decoding data structure, and further reduces
            the occupied memory. An empirical analysis on realworld datasets shows
            that with a reasonable overhead our technique uses 50–59% less memory
            than a conventional uncompressed dictionary.

        abstractNote: We motivate and describe techniques that allow to detect an
            "emergent" relational schema from RDF data. We show that on a wide variety
            of datasets, the found structure explains well over 90% of the RDF triples.
            Further, we also describe technical solutions to the semantic challenge
            to give short names that humans find logical to these emergent tables,
            columns and relationships between tables. Our techniques can be exploited
            in many ways, e.g., to improve the efficiency of SPARQL systems, or to
            use existing SQL-based applications on top of any RDF dataset using a
            RDBMS.

        abstractNote: 'The Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC) is now two years underway
            and has gathered strong industrial participation for its mission to establish
            benchmarks, and benchmarking practices for evaluating graph data management
            systems. The LDBC introduced a new choke-point driven methodology for
            developing benchmark workloads, which combines user input with input from
            expert systems architects, which we outline. This paper describes the
            LDBC Social Network Benchmark (SNB), and presents database benchmarking
            innovation in terms of graph query functionality tested, correlated graph
            generation techniques, as well as a scalable benchmark driver on a workload
            with complex graph dependencies. SNB has three query workloads under development:
            Interactive, Business Intelligence, and Graph Algorithms. We describe
            the SNB Interactive Workload in detail and illustrate the workload with
            some early results, as well as the goals for the two other workloads.'

        abstractNote: Graphs are increasingly used in industry, governance, and science.
            This has stimulated the appearance of many and diverse graph-processing
            platforms. Although platform di- versity is beneficial, it also makes
            it very challenging to select the best platform for an application domain
            or one of its im- portant applications, and to design new and tune existing
            platforms. Continuing a long tradition of using benchmark- ing to address
            such challenges, in this work we present our vision for Graphalytics,
            a big data benchmark for graph- processing platforms. We have already
            benchmarked with Graphalytics a variety of popular platforms, such as
            Giraph, GraphX, and Neo4j.

        abstractNote: Accounting for patients with multiple health conditions is a
            complex task that requires analysing potential interactions among recommendations
            meant to address each condition. Although some approaches have been proposed
            to address this issue, important features still require more investigation,
            such as (re)usability and scalability. To this end, this paper presents
            an approach that relies on reusable rules for detecting interactions among
            recommendations coming from various guidelines. It extends previously
            proposed models by introducing the notions of action type hierarchy and
            causation beliefs, and provides a systematic analysis of relevant interactions
            in the context of multimorbidity. Finally, the approach is assessed based
            on a case-study taken from the literature to highlight the added value
            of the approach.

        abstractNote: While catchphrases such as big data, smart data, data-intensive
            science, or smart dust highlight different aspects, they share a common
            theme - namely, a shift toward a data-centered perspective in which the
            synthesis and analysis of data at an ever-increasing spatial, temporal,
            and thematic resolution promise new insights, while, at the same time,
            reduce the need for strong domain theories as starting points. In terms
            of the envisioned methodologies, those catchphrases tend to emphasize
            the role of predictive analytics, that is, statistical techniques including
            data mining and machine learning, as well as supercomputing. Interestingly,
            however, while this perspective takes the availability of data as a given,
            it does not answer the question how one would discover the required data
            in today's chaotic information universe, how one would understand which
            data sets can be meaningfully integrated, and how to communicate the results
            to humans and machines alike. The semantic web addresses these questions.
            In the following, we argue why the data train needs semantic rails. We
            point out that making sense of data and gaining new insights work best
            if inductive and deductive techniques go hand-in-hand instead of competing
            over the prerogative of interpretation.

            professional music production environments. For decades, MIDI (Musical
            Instrument Digital Interface) has been the standard for digital music
            exchange between musicians and devices, albeit not in a Web friendly way.
            We show the potential of expressing digital music as Linked Data, using
            our midi2rdf suite of tools to convert and stream digital music in MIDI
            format to RDF. The conversion allows for lossless round tripping: we can
            reconstruct a MIDI file identical to the original using its RDF representation.
            The streaming uses an existing, novel generative audio matching algorithm
            that we use to broadcast, with very low latency, RDF triples of MIDI events
            coming from arbitrary analog instruments.'

        abstractNote: SWISH provides a general purpose collaborative infrastructure
            for applying Prolog reasoning over an RDF dataset together with features
            that facilitates prototyping Semantic Web applications. In this paper
            we report on the use of SWISH for efficiently developing a prototype for
            detection of clinical guideline interactions. These guidelines are a set
            of medical recommendations meant for supporting doctors on tackling a
            single disease. However, often guidelines need to be combined for treating
            patients that suffer from multiple diseases, and then a number of interactions
            can occur. The generic interaction rules are implemented in SWI-Prolog
            and the guideline RDF-data is enriched with clinical Linked Open Data
            (LOD) (e.g. Drugbank, Sider). We show the implementation of the proposed
            theory about interaction detection in a case-study on combining three
            guidelines. The experiment is interactively described using a SWISH notebook
            and the results are graphical visualised empowered by graphviz.

        abstractNote: Historical censuses have an enormous potential for research.
            In order to fully use this potential, harmonization of these censuses
            is essential. During the last decades, enormous efforts have been undertaken
            in digitizing the published aggregated outcomes of the Dutch historical
            censuses (1795-1971). Although the accessibility has been improved enormously,
            researchers must cope with hundreds of heterogeneous and disconnected
            Excel tables. As a result, the census is still for the most part an untapped
            source of information. The authors describe the main harmonization challenges
            of the census and how they work toward one harmonized dataset. They propose
            a specific approach and model in creating an interlinked census dataset
            in the Semantic Web using the Resource Description Framework technology.

        abstractNote: Many ICT applications and services, including those from the
            Semantic Web, rely on the Web for the exchange of data. This includes
            expensive server and network infrastructures. Most rural areas of developing
            countries are not reached by the Web and its possibilities, while at the
            same time the ability to share knowledge has been identified as a key
            enabler for development. To make widespread knowledge sharing possible
            in these rural areas, the notion of the Web has to be downscaled based
            on the specific low-resource infrastructure in place. In this paper, we
            introduce SPARQL over SMS, a solution for Web-like exchange of RDF data
            over cellular networks in which HTTP is substituted by SMS. We motivate
            and validate this through two use cases in West Africa. We present the
            design and implementation of the solution, along with a data compression
            method that combines generic compression strategies and strategies that
            use Semantic Web specific features to reduce the size of RDF before it
            is transferred over the low-bandwidth cellular network.

        abstractNote: In this paper we report the results of Phil@Scale, a project
            directed at the development of computational methods for (the history
            of) philosophy.1 In this project, philosophers and computer scientists
            together created SalVe, a tool that helps philosophers answering text-based
            questions. SalVe has been tested successfully on the Wissenschaftslehre
            (1837), an extensive work by the Bohemian polymath Bernard Bolzano (1781-1848).
            Bolzano was a philosopher, mathematician and theologian whose work has
            been of fundamental importance for the development of Western logic and
            the foundation of sciences such as mathematics and computer science. The
            testing of SalVe on the Wissenschaftslehre reveals that with respect to
            certain questions within philosophy valuable contributions are obtained
            by applying even rather simple, well-known computational techniques. We
            conclude that there is definitely a future for computational methods within
            text-based philosophical research. We explain how SalVe can be used within
            philosophical research that relies on textual sources. We will start out
            with an explanation of our aims in developing SalVe and give a short description
            of SalVe's functionalities, followed by a technical description of the
            tool. Then we will give a concrete example of how SalVe aids philosophical
            research. We conclude the paper with an evaluation of the potential of
            Digital Humanities tools for philosophy, and the challenges that face
            us if we wish to continue this development further.

        abstractNote: 'Here, we describe the RISIS-SMS metadata system, developed
            to support the use of heterogeneous datasets in the field of Science,
            Technology and Innovation Studies (STIS). These data are partly within
            the RISIS infrastructure, but often elsewhere. The system has three aims:
            (i) to help researchers to search for and understand data that will help
            to answer specific research questions, without having to access or download
            the data. As datasets often have restricted access, browsing metadata
            is a key feature of the system: researchers need help identifying the
            relevant data from different sources for their research, and for which
            data it is worthwhile asking for access; (ii) to support the enrichment
            of dataBy linking the metadata system to the Linked Open Data environment
            (LOD); (iii) to facilitate application-driven data integration.'

            index by choosing and combining the matching and ranking algorithms that
            suit their use case best. In this paper, we explain the LOTUS approach,
            its implementation and the functionality it provides. We demonstrate the
            ease with which LOTUS enables text-based resource retrieval at an unprecedented
            scale in con- crete and domain-specific scenarios. Finally, we provide
            evidence for the scalability of LOTUS with respect to the LOD Laundromat,
            the largest collection of easily accessible Linked Open Data currently
            available.'

        abstractNote: This paper presents Linked Data Reactor (LD-Reactor or LD-R)
            as a framework for developing exible and reusable User Interface components
            for Linked Data applications. LD-Reactor utilizes Facebook's ReactJS components,
            Flux architecture and Yahoo's Fluxible framework for isomorphic Web applications.
            It also exploits Semantic-UI framework for exible UI themes. LD-R aims
            to apply the idea of component-based application development into RDF
            data model hence enhancing current user interfaces to view, browse and
            edit Linked Data.

        abstractNote: Rule-based formalization of eligibility criteria in clinical
            trials have distinguished features such as declaration, easy maintenance,
            reusability, and expressiveness. In this paper, we present several knowledge
            services which can be provided by the rule-based formalization of eligibility
            criteria. The rule-based formalization can be generated automatically
            by using the logic programming Prolog with the support of NLP tools for
            the semantic annotation and relation extraction with medical ontologies/terminologies
            such as UMLS and SNOMED CT. We show how those automatically generated
            rule-based formalization for eligibility criteria can be used for the
            patient recruitment service in SemanticCT, a semantically-enabled system
            for clinical trials.

        abstractNote: In this paper we introduce LDBC Graphalytics, a new industrial-grade
            benchmark for graph analysis platforms. It consists of six deterministic
            algorithms, standard datasets, synthetic dataset generators, and reference
            output, that enable the objective comparison of graph analysis platforms.
            Its test harness produces deep metrics that quantify multiple kinds of
            system scalability, such as horizontal/vertical and weak/strong, and of
            robustness, such as failures and performance variability. The benchmark
            comes with open-source software for generating data and monitoring performance.
            We describe and analyze six implementations of the benchmark (three from
            the community, three from the industry), providing insights into the strengths
            and weaknesses of the platforms. Key to our contribution, vendors perform
            the tuning and benchmarking of their platforms.

        abstractNote: The formal representation of clinical knowledge is still an
            open research topic. Classical representation languages for clinical guidelines
            are used to produce diagnostic and treatment plans. However, they have
            important limitations, e.g. when looking for ways to re-use, combine,
            and reason over existing clinical knowledge. These limitations are especially
            problematic in the context of multimorbidity; patients that suffer from
            multiple diseases. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes
            a model for clinical guidelines (TMR4I) that allows the re-use and combination
            of knowledge from multiple guidelines. Semantic Web technology is applied
            to implement the model, allowing us to automatically infer interactions
            between recommendations, such as recommending the same drug more than
            once. It relies on an existing Linked Data set, DrugBank, for identifying
            drug-drug interactions. We evaluate the model by applying it to two realistic
            case studies on multimorbidity that combine guidelines for two (Duodenal
            Ulcer and Transient Ischemic Attack) and three diseases (Osteoarthritis,
            Hypertension and Diabetes) and compare the results with existing methods.

        abstractNote: Finding a good join order is crucial for query performance.
            In this paper, we introduce the Join Order Benchmark (JOB) and experimentally
            revisit the main components in the classic query optimizer architecture
            using a complex, real-world data set and realistic multi-join queries.
            We investigate the quality of industrial-strength cardinality estimators
            and find that all estimators routinely produce large errors. We further
            show that while estimates are essential for finding a good join order,
            query performance is unsatisfactory if the query engine relies too heavily
            on these estimates. Using another set of experiments that measure the
            impact of the cost model, we find that it has much less influence on query
            performance than the cardinality estimates. Finally, we investigate plan
            enumeration techniques comparing exhaustive dynamic programming with heuristic
            algorithms and find that exhaustive enumeration improves performance despite
            the sub-optimal cardinality estimates.

        abstractNote: Building Web APIs on top of SPARQL endpoints is becoming common
            practice. It enables universal access to the integration favorable data
            space of Linked Data. In the majority of use cases, users cannot be expected
            to learn SPARQL to query this data space. Web APIs are the most common
            way to enable programmatic access to data on the Web. However, the implementation
            of Web APIs around Linked Data is often a tedious and repetitive process.
            Recent work speeds up this Linked Data API construction by wrapping it
            around SPARQL queries, which carry out the API functionality under the
            hood. Inspired by this development, in this paper we present grlc, a lightweight
            server that takes SPARQL queries curated in GitHub repositories, and translates
            them to Linked Data APIs on the fly.

        abstractNote: 'This paper presents a method for formally representing Computer-Interpretable
            Guidelines to deal with multimorbidity. Although some approaches for merging
            guidelines exist, improvements are still required for combining several
            sources of information and coping with possibly conflicting pieces of
            evidence coming from clinical studies. Our main contribution is twofold:
            (i) we provide general models and rules for representing guidelines that
            expresses evidence as causation beliefs; (ii) we introduce a mechanism
            to exploit external medical knowledge acquired from Linked Open Data (Drugbank,
            Sider, DIKB) to detect potential interactions between recommendations.
            We apply this framework to merge three guidelines (Osteoarthritis, Diabetes,
            and Hypertension) in order to illustrate the capability of this approach
            for detecting potential conflicts between guidelines and eventually propose
            alternatives.'

        abstractNote: We build on our earlier finding that more than 95% of the triples
            in actual RDF triple graphs have a remarkably tabular structure, whose
            schema does not necessarily follow from explicit metadata such as ontologies,
            but for which an RDF store can automatically derive by looking at the
            data using so-called “emergent schema” detection techniques. In this paper
            we investigate how computers and in particular RDF stores can take advantage
            from this emergent schema to more compactly store RDF data and more efficiently
            optimize and execute SPARQL queries. To this end, we contribute techniques
            for efficient emergent schema aware RDF storage and new query operator
            algorithms for emergent schema aware scans and joins. In all, these techniques
            allow RDF schema processors fully catch up with relational database techniques
            in terms of rich physical database design options and efficiency, without
            requiring a rigid upfront schema structure definition.

        abstractNote: Evidence-based Medical guidelines are developed based on the
            best available evidence in biomedical science and clinical practice. Such
            evidence-based medical guidelines should be regularly updated, so that
            they can optimally serve medical practice by using the latest evidence
            from medical research. The usual approach to detect such new evidence
            is to use a set of terms from a guideline recommendation and to create
            queries for a biomedical search engine such as PubMed, with a ranking
            over a selected subset of terms to search for relevant new evidence. However,
            the terms that appear in a guideline recommendation do not always cover
            all of the information we need for the search, because the contextual
            information (e.g. time and location, user profile, topics) is usually
            missing in a guideline recommendation. Enhancing the search terms with
            contextual information would improve the quality of the search results.
            In this paper, we propose a topic-centric approach to detect new evidence
            for updating evidence-based medical guidelines as a context-aware method
            to improve the search. Our experiments show that this topic centric approach
            can find the goal evidence for 12 guideline statements out of 16 in our
            test set, compared with only 5 guideline statements that were found by
            using a non-topic centric approach.

        abstractNote: The main promise of the digital humanities is the ability to
            perform scholar studies at a much broader scale, and in a much more reusable
            fashion. The key enabler for such studies is the availability of sufficiently
            well described data. For the field of socio-economic history, data usually
            comes in a tabular form. Existing efforts to curate and publish datasets
            take a top-down approach and are focused on large collections. This paper
            presents QBer and the underlying structured datahub, which address the
            long tail of research data by catering for the needs of individual scholars.
            QBer allows researchers to publish their (small) datasets, link them to
            existing vocabularies and other datasets, and thereby contribute to a
            growing collection of interlinked datasets. We present QBer, and evaluate
            our first results by showing how our system facilitates two use cases
            in socio-economic history.

        abstractNote: Due to the increasing amount of Linked Data openly published
            on the Web, user-facing Linked Data Applications (LDAs) are gaining momentum.
            One of the major entrance barriers for Web developers to contribute to
            this wave of LDAs is the required knowledge of Semantic Web (SW) technologies
            such as the RDF data model and SPARQL query language. This paper presents
            an adaptive component-based approach together with its open source implementation
            for creating flexible and reusable SW interfaces driven by Linked Data.
            Linked Data-driven (LD-R) Web components abstract the complexity of the
            underlying SW technologies in order to allow reuse of existing Web components
            in LDAs, enabling Web developers who are not experts in SW to develop
            interfaces that view, edit and browse Linked Data. In addition to the
            modularity provided by the LD-R components, the proposed RDF-based configuration
            method allows application assemblers to reshape their user interface for
            different use cases, by either reusing existing shared configurations
            or by creating their proprietary configurations.

        abstractNote: 'Text-based and semantics-based methods are both studied intensively
            as methods for document retrieval. In order to gain insight in the respective
            merits of these two approaches, we have performed a controlled experiment
            where we executed a real-life task using both textbased and semantics-based
            techniques. To maximise the lessons that we could draw about the two approaches,
            we have performed an experiment where we used the same task (searching
            papers from the scientific literature needed for updating a medical guideline),
            the same test-case (updating the 2004 Dutch national breast-cancer guideline),
            the same gold standard (the updated 2012 Dutch national breast-cancer
            guideline) and the same corpus (PubMed). We then performed this task using
            two different methods: retrieving papers based on keywords (text-based
            approach) and retrieving papers based on semantic annotations (semantics-based
            approach). Based on this experiment, we discuss the insights that we gained
            from this dual set of experiments.'

        abstractNote: According to its model-theoretic semantics, Semantic Web IRIs
            are individual constants or predicate letters whose names are chosen arbitrarily
            and carry no formal meaning. At the same time it is a well-known aspect
            of Semantic Web pragmatics that IRIs are often constructed mnemonically,
            in order to be meaningful to a human interpreter. The latter has traditionally
            been termed ‘social meaning’, a concept that has been discussed but not
            yet quantitatively studied by the Semantic Web community. In this paper
            we use measures of mutual information content and methods from statistical
            model learning to quantify the meaning that is (at least) encoded in Semantic
            Web names. We implement the approach and evaluate it over hundreds of
            thousands of datasets in order to illustrate its efficacy. Our experiments
            confirm that many Semantic Web names are indeed meaningful and, more interestingly,
            we provide a quantitative lower bound on how much meaning is encoded in
            names on a per-dataset basis. To our knowledge, this is the first paper
            about the interaction between social and formal meaning, as well as the
            first paper that uses statistical model learning as a method to quantify
            meaning in the Semantic Web context. These insights are useful for the
            design of a new generation of Semantic Web tools that take such social
            meaning into account.

        abstractNote: A common approach to software architecture documentation in
            industry projects is the use of file-based documents. This approach offers
            a single-dimensional arrangement of the architectural knowledge. Knowledge
            retrieval from file-based architecture documentation is efficient if the
            organisation of knowledge supports the needs of the readers; otherwise
            it can be difficult. In this paper, we compare the organisation and retrieval
            of architectural knowledge in a file-based documentation approach and
            an ontology-based documentation approach. The ontology-based approach
            offers a multi-dimensional organisation of architectural knowledge by
            means of a software ontology and semantic wiki, whereas file-based documentation
            typically uses hierarchical organisation by directory structure and table
            of content. We conducted case studies in two companies to study the efficiency
            and effectiveness of retrieving architectural knowledge from the different
            organisations of knowledge. We found that the use of better knowledge
            organisation correlates with the efficiency and effectiveness of AK retrieval.
            Professionals who used the knowledge organisation found this beneficial.

        abstractNote: Analytical workloads in data warehouses often include heavy
            joins where queries involve multiple fact tables in addition to the typical
            star-patterns, dimensional grouping and selections. In this paper we propose
            a new processing and storage framework called bitwise dimensional co-clustering
            (BDCC) that avoids replication and thus keeps updates fast, yet is able
            to accelerate all these foreign key joins, efficiently support grouping
            and pushes down most dimensional selections. The core idea of BDCC is
            to cluster each table on a mix of dimensions, each possibly derived from
            attributes imported over an incoming foreign key and this way creating
            foreign key connected tables with partially shared clusterings. These
            are later used to accelerate any join between two tables that have some
            dimension in common and additionally permit to push down and propagate
            selections (reduce I/O) and accelerate aggregation and ordering operations.
            Besides the general framework, we describe an algorithm to derive such
            a physical co-clustering database automatically and describe query processing
            and query optimization techniques that can easily be fitted into existing
            relational engines. We present an experimental evaluation on the TPC-H
            benchmark in the Vectorwise system, showing that co-clustering can significantly
            enhance its already high performance and at the same time significantly
            reduce the memory consumption of the system.

        abstractNote: ClioPatria is a comprehensive semantic web development framework
            based on SWI-Prolog. SWI-Prolog provides an efficient C-based main-memory
            RDF store that is designed to cooperate naturally and efficiently with
            Prolog, realizing a flexible RDF-based environment for rule based programming.
            ClioPatria extends this core with a SPARQL and LOD server, an extensible
            web frontend to manage the server, browse the data, query the data using
            SPARQL and Prolog and a Git-based plugin manager. The ability to query
            RDF using Prolog provides query composition and smooth integration with
            application logic. ClioPatria is primarily positioned as a prototyping
            platform for exploring novel ways of reasoning with RDF data. It has been
            used in several research projects in order to perform tasks such as data
            integration and enrichment and semantic search.

        abstractNote: This work aims at reducing the main-memory footprint in high
            performance hybrid OLTP&OLAP databases, while retaining high query performance
            and transactional throughput. For this purpose, an innovative compressed
            columnar storage format for cold data, called Data Blocks is introduced.
            Data Blocks further incorporate a new light-weight index structure called
            Positional SMA that narrows scan ranges within Data Blocks even if the
            entire block cannot be ruled out. To achieve highest OLTP performance,
            the compression schemes of Data Blocks are very light-weight, such that
            OLTP transactions can still quickly access individual tuples. This sets
            our storage scheme apart from those used in specialized analytical databases
            where data must usually be bit-unpacked. Up to now, high-performance analytical
            systems use either vectorized query execution or "just-in-time" (JIT)
            query compilation. The fine-grained adaptivity of Data Blocks necessitates
            the integration of the best features of each approach by an interpreted
            vectorized scan subsystem feeding into JIT-compiled query pipelines. Experimental
            evaluation of HyPer, our full-edged hybrid OLTP&OLAP database system,
            shows that Data Blocks accelerate performance on a variety of query workloads
            while retaining high transaction throughput.

        abstractNote: Identity relations are at the foundation of the Semantic Web
            and the Linked Data Cloud. In many instances the classical interpretation
            of identity is too strong for practical purposes. This is particularly
            the case when two entities are considered the same in some but not all
            contexts. Unfortunately, modeling the specific contexts in which an identity
            relation holds is cumbersome and, due to arbitrary reuse and the Open
            World Assumption, it is impossible to anticipate all contexts in which
            an entity will be used. We propose an alternative semantics for owl:sameAs
            that partitions the original relation into a hierarchy of subrelations.
            The subrelation to which an identity statement belongs depends on the
            dataset in which the statement occurs. Adding future assertions may change
            the subrelation to which an identity statement belongs, resulting in a
            context-dependent and non-monotonic semantics. We show that this more
            fine-grained semantics is better able to characterize the actual use of
            owl:sameAs as observed in Linked Open Datasets.

        abstractNote: Actian Vector in Hadoop (VectorH for short) is a new SQL-on-Hadoop
            system built on top of the fast Vectorwise analytical database system.
            VectorH achieves fault tolerance and storage scalability by relying on
            HDFS, and extends the state-of-the-art in SQL-on-Hadoop systems by instrumenting
            the HDFS replication policy to optimize read locality. VectorH integrates
            with YARN for workload management, achieving a high degree of elasticity.
            Even though HDFS is an append-only file-system, and VectorH supports (update-averse)
            ordered tables, trickle updates are possible thanks to Positional Delta
            Trees (PDTs), a diffferential update structure that can be queried efficiently.
            We describe the changes made to single-server Vectorwise to turn it into
            a Hadoop-based MPP system, encompassing workload management, parallel
            query optimization and execution, HDFS storage, transaction processing
            and Spark integration. We evaluate VectorH against HAWQ, Impala, SparkSQL
            and Hive, showing orders of magnitude better performance.

        abstractNote: Over the past years, research utilizing routine care data extracted
            from Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) has increased tremendously. Yet
            there are no straightforward, standardized strategies for pre-processing
            these data. We propose a dedicated medical pre-processing pipeline aimed
            at taking on many problems and opportunities contained within EMR data,
            such as their temporal, inaccurate and incomplete nature. The pipeline
            is demonstrated on a dataset of routinely recorded data in general practice
            EMRs of over 260,000 patients, in which the occurrence of colorectal cancer
            (CRC) is predicted using various machine learning techniques (i.e., CART,
            LR, RF) and subsets of the data. CRC is a common type of cancer, of which
            early detection has proven to be important yet challenging. The results
            are threefold. First, the predictive models generated using our pipeline
            reconfirmed known predictors and identified new, medically plausible,
            predictors derived from the cardiovascular and metabolic disease domain,
            validating the pipeline's effectiveness. Second, the difference between
            the best model generated by the data-driven subset (AUC 0.891) and the
            best model generated by the current state of the art hypothesis-driven
            subset (AUC 0.864) is statistically significant at the 95% confidence
            interval level. Third, the pipeline itself is highly generic and independent
            of the specific disease targeted and the EMR used. In conclusion, the
            application of established machine learning techniques in combination
            with the proposed pipeline on EMRs has great potential to enhance disease
            prediction, and hence early detection and intervention in medical practice.

            efficient and intelligent. Under the framework of the Wisdom Web of Things
            (W2T), we design a monitoring system for the SBS, by using the semantic
            technology. This system establishes a data cycle among the physical world
            (buildings), the social world (humans) and the cyber world (computers),
            and provides various services in the monitoring process to alleviate the
            engineers’ workload. In this system, the sensors which are connected via
            cable or wireless way, are used to monitor the different parameters of
            building structure. The semantic data can be obtained and represented
            by RDF to describe the meanings of sensor data, and can provide the application
            background for users. LarKC, a platform for scalable semantic data processing,
            is used for semantic querying about the data. Based on this uniform representation
            of data and semantic processing, intelligent services can be provided
            by the effective data analysis. This provides the possibility to integrate
            all of the monitoring systems for the safety of building structure in
            urban computing.

        abstractNote: An emerging hyper-world encompasses all human activities in
            a social-cyber-physical space. Its power derives from the Wisdom Web of
            Things (W2T) cycle, namely, “from things to data, information, knowledge,
            wisdom, services, humans, and then back to things.” The W2T cycle leads
            to a harmonious symbiosis among humans, computers and things, which can
            be constructed by large-scale converging of intelligent information technology
            applications with an open and interoperable architecture. The recent advances
            in cloud computing, the Internet/Web of Things, big data and other research
            fields have provided just such an open system architecture with resource
            sharing/services. The next step is therefore to develop an open and interoperable
            content architecture with intelligence sharing/services for the organization
            and transformation in the “data, information, knowledge and wisdom (DIKW)”
            hierarchy. This chapter introduces Wisdom as a Service (WaaS) as a content
            architecture based on the “paying only for what you use” IT business trend.
            The WaaS infrastructure, WaaS economics, and the main challenges in WaaS
            research and applications are discussed. A case study is described to
            demonstrate the usefulness and significance of WaaS. Relying on the clouds
            (cloud computing), things (Internet of Things) and big data, WaaS provides
            a practical approach to realize the W2T cycle in the hyper-world for the
            coming age of ubiquitous intelligent IT applications.

        abstractNote: With the increasing popularity of mobile phones, large amounts
            of real and reliable mobile phone data are being generated every day.
            These mobile phone data represent the practical travel routes of users
            and imply the intelligence of them in selecting a suitable route. Usually,
            an experienced user knows which route is congested in a specified period
            of time but unblocked in another period of time. Moreover, a route used
            frequently and recently by a user is usually the suitable one to satisfy
            the user’s needs. ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) is a computational
            cognitive architecture, which provides a good framework to understand
            the principles and mechanisms of information organization, retrieval and
            selection in human memory. In this chapter, we employ ACT-R to model the
            process of selecting a suitable route of users. We propose a cognition-inspired
            route recommendation method to mine the intelligence of users in selecting
            a suitable route, evaluate the suitability of the routes, and recommend
            an ordered list of routes for subscribers. Experiments show that it is
            effective and feasible to recommend the suitable routes inspired by cognition.

        abstractNote: 'The size and complexity of the Semantic Web and its technology
            stack makes it difficult to query. Access to Linked Data could be greatly
            facilitated if it were supported by a tool with a strong focus on usability.
            In this paper we present the YASGUI family of SPARQL clients, a continuation
            of the YASGUI tool introduced more than two years ago. The YASGUI family
            of SPARQL clients enables publishers to improve ease of access for their
            SPARQL endpoints, and gives consumers of Linked Data a robust, feature-rich
            and user friendly SPARQL editor. We show that the YASGUI family had significant
            impact on the landscape of Linked Data management: YASGUI components are
            integrated in state-of-the-art triple-stores and Linked Data applications,
            and used as front-end by a large number of Linked Data publishers. Additionally,
            we show that the YASGUI web service - which provides access to any SPARQL
            endpoint - has a large and growing user base amongst Linked Data consumers.'

        abstractNote: The emergence of Linked Open Data (LOD) enables data on the
            Web to have a well defined structure and thereby to represent and in?
            terlink information from different sources and application areas. This
            web of data is a complex socially created network, where concepts and
            rela? tions are connected in intricate ways, collectively forming a network
            of knowledge. These data are published in a decentralized fashion and
            they stem from different sources, have different types of relationships,
            and use different terminologies, ontologies and meta models. While this
            so-called LOD cloud has become a very valuable resource, we know only
            very little about the general structural properties of the contained data,
            which im? pedes our ability to use and organize this resource in an efficient
            and accu? rate manner. The objective of this paper is to provide a basic
            understand? ing of LOD from the point of view of network structures. We
            analyze LOD networks with respect to fundamental network properties such
            as degree distribution and clustering. Using these metrics, we compare
            our results to non-LOD networks, such as email, Web, and protein networks,
            that have been reported in the literature. Our results show that the LOD
            cloud ex? hibits a broad variety of different network structures, consistent
            with the diversity found in other types of networks.

        abstractNote: In this deliverable we describe the SMS (Semantically Mapping
            Science) data integration platform (http://sms.risis.eu), the technical
            core within the RISIS data infrastructure for Science, Technology and
            Innovation Studies (STI). The aim of the platform is to produce richer
            data to be used in social research – through the integration of heterogeneous
            datasets, ranging from tabular statistical data to unstructured data found
            on the Web. We outline the platform’s architecture and functions. There
            arealso some example use cases mentioned to show how the platform enables
            data integration in practice.

        abstractNote: With tens if not hundreds of billions of logical statements,
            the Linked Open Data (LOD) is one of the biggest knowledge bases ever
            built. As such it is a gigantic source of information for applications
            in various domains, but also given its size an ideal test-bed for knowledge
            representation and reasoning, heterogeneous nature, and complexity. However,
            making use of this unique resource has proven next to impossible in the
            past due to a number of problems, including data collection, quality,
            accessibility, scalability, availability and findability. The LOD Laundromat
            and LOD Lab are recent infrastructures that addresses these problems in
            a systematic way, by automatically crawling, cleaning, indexing, analysing
            and republishing data in a unified way. Given a family of simple tools,
            LOD Lab allows researchers to query, access, analyse and manipulate hundreds
            of thousands of data documents seamlessly, e.g. facilitating experiments
            (e.g. for reasoning) over hundreds of thousands of (possibly integrated)
            datasets based on content and meta-data. This chapter provides the theoretical
            basis and practical skills required for making ideal use of this large
            scale experimental platform. First we study the problems that make it
            so hard to work with Semantic Web data in its current form. We’ll also
            propose generic solutions and introduce the tools the reader needs to
            get started with their own experiments on the LOD Cloud.

        abstractNote: Serendipity, the art of making an unsought finding plays also
            an important role in the emerging field of data science, allowing the
            discovery of interesting and valuable facts not initially sought for.
            Previous research has extracted many serendipity-fostering patterns applicable
            to digital data-driven systems. Linked Open Data (LOD) on the Web which
            is powered by the Follow-Your-Nose effect, provides already a rich source
            for serendipity. The serendipity most often takes place when browsing
            data. Therefore, flexible and intuitive browsing user interfaces which
            support serendipity triggers such as enigmas, anomalies and novelties,
            can increase the likelihood of serendipity on LOD. In this work, we propose
            a set of serendipity-fostering design features supported by an adaptive
            multigraph-based faceted browsing interface to catalyze serendipity on
            Semantic Web and LOD environments.

        abstractNote: Clinical quality indicators are tools to measure the quality
            of healthcare and can be classified into structure-related, process-related
            and outcome-related indicators. The objective of this study is to investigate
            whether Electronic Medical Record (EMR) data from a Chinese diabetes specialty
            hospital can be used for the automated computation of a set of 38 diabetes
            quality indicators, especially process-related indicators. The clinical
            quality indicator formalization (CLIF) method and tool and SNOMED CT were
            adopted to formalize diabetes indicators into executable queries. The
            formalized indicators were run on the patient data to test the feasibility
            of their automated computation. In this study, we successfully formalized
            and computed 32 of 38 quality indicators based on the EMR data. The results
            indicate that the data from our Chinese EMR can be used for the formalization
            and computation of most diabetes indicators, but that it can be improved
            to support the computation of more indicators.

        abstractNote: Linking between entities in different datasets is a crucial
            element of the Semantic Web architecture, since those links allow us to
            integrate datasets without having to agree on a uniform vocabulary. However,
            it is widely acknowledged that the owl:sameAs construct is too blunt a
            tool for this purpose. It entails full equality between two resources
            independent of context. But whether or not two resources should be considered
            equal depends not only on their intrinsic properties, but also on the
            purpose or task for which the resources are used. We present a system
            for constructing contextspecific equality links. In a first step, our
            system generates a set of probable links between two given datasets. These
            potential links are decorated with rich metadata describing how, why,
            when and by whom they were generated. In a second step, a user then selects
            the links which are suited for the current task and context, constructing
            a context-specific “Lenticular Lens”. Such lenses can be combined using
            operators such as union, intersection, difference and composition. We
            illustrate and validate our approach with

        abstractNote: Evidence-based medical guidelines are systematically developed
            recommendations with the aim to assist practitioner and patients decisions
            regarding appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances,
            and are based on evidence described in medical research papers. Evidence-based
            medical guidelines should be regularly updated, such that they can serve
            medical practice using based on the latest medical research evidence.
            A usual approach to detecting new evidences is to use a set of terms which
            appear in a guideline conclusion or recommendation and create queries
            over a bio-medical search engine such as PubMed with a ranking over a
            selected subset of terms to search for relevant new research papers. However,
            the sizes of the found relevant papers are usually very large (i.e. over
            a few hundreds, even thousands), which results in a low precision of the
            search. This makes it for medical professionals quite difficult to find
            which papers are really interesting and useful for updating the guideline.
            We propose a filtering step to decrease the number of papers. More exactly
            we are interested in the question if we can reduce the number of papers
            with no or a slightly lower recall. A plausible approach is to introduce
            journal filtering, such that evidence appear in those top journals are
            preferred. In this paper, we extend our approach of detecting new papers
            for updating evidence-based medical guideline with a journal filtering
            step. We report our experiments and show that (1) the method with journal
            filtering can indeed gain a large reduction of the number of papers (69.73%)
            with a slightly lower recall (14.29%); (2) we show that the journal filtering
            method keeps relatively more high level evidence papers (category A) and
            removes all the low level evidence papers (category D).

        abstractNote: Here, we describe the CEDAR dataset, a five-star Linked Open
            Data representation of the Dutch historical censuses. These were conducted
            in the Netherlands once every 10 years from 1795 to 1971. We produce a
            linked dataset from a digitized sample of 2,288 tables. It contains more
            than 6.8 million statistical observations about the demography, labour
            and housing of Dutch society in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries. The
            dataset is modeled using the RDF Data Cube, Open Annotation, and PROV
            vocabularies. These are used to represent the multidimensionality of the
            data, to express rules of data harmonization, and to keep track of the
            provenance of all data points and their transformations, respectively.
            We link observations within the dataset to well known standard classification
            systems in social history, such as the Historical International Standard
            Classification of Occupations (HISCO) and the Amsterdamse Code (AC). The
            three contributions of the dataset are (1) an easier access to integrated
            census data for historical researchers; (2) richer connections to related
            Linked Data resources; and (3) novel concept schemes of historical relevance,
            like classifications of historical religions and historical house types.

        abstractNote: This paper introduces the LOD Laundromat meta-dataset, a continuously
            updated RDF meta-dataset that describes the documents crawled, cleaned
            and (re)published by the LOD Laundromat. This meta-dataset of over 110
            million triples contains structural information for more than 650,000
            documents (and growing). Dataset meta-data is often not provided alongside
            published data, it is incomplete or it is incomparable given the way they
            were generated. The LOD Laundromat meta-dataset provides a wide range
            of structural dataset properties, such as the number of triples in LOD
            Laundromat documents, the average degree in documents, and the distinct
            number of Blank Nodes, Literals and IRIs. This makes it a particularly
            useful dataset for data comparison and analytics, as well as for the global
            study of the Web of Data. This paper presents the dataset, its requirements,
            and its impact.

        abstractNote: Accounting for patients with multiple health conditions is a
            complex task that requires analysing potential interactions among recommendations
            meant to address each condition. Although some approaches have been proposed
            to address this issue, important features still require more investigation,
            such as (re)usability and scalability. To this end, this paper presents
            an approach that relies on reusable rules for detecting interactions among
            recommendations coming from various guidelines. It extends a previously
            proposed knowledge representation model (TMR) to enhance the detection
            of interactions and it provides a systematic analysis of relevant interactions
            in the context of multimorbidity. The approach is evaluated in a case
            study on rehabilitation of breast cancer patients, developed in collaboration
            with experts. The results are considered promising to support the experts
            in this task.

        abstractNote: Knowledge Graphs have been shown to be useful tools for integrating
            multiple medical knowledge sources, and to support such tasks as medical
            decision making, literature retrieval, determining healthcare quality
            indicators, co-morbodity analysis and many others. A large number of medical
            knowledge sources have by now been converted to knowledge graphs, covering
            everything from drugs to trials and from vocabularies to gene-disease
            associations. Such knowledge graphs have typically been generic, covering
            very large areas of medicine. (e.g. all of internal medicine, or arbitrary
            drugs, arbitrary trials, etc.). This has had the effect that such knowledge
            graphs become prohibitively large, hampering both efficiency for machines
            and usability for people. In this paper we show how we use multiple large
            knowledge sources to construct a much smaller knowledge graph that is
            focussed on single disease (in our case major depression disorder). Such
            a disease-centric knowledge-graph makes it more convenient for doctors

        abstractNote: In this paper we show how we used multiple large knowledge sources
            to construct a much smaller knowledge graph that is focussed on single
            disease (in our case major depression disorder). Such a disease-centric
            knowledge-graph makes it more convenient for doctors (in our case psychiatric
            doctors) to explore the relationship among various knowledge resources
            and to answer realistic clinical queries.

        abstractNote: 'Recent years have witnessed a growing interest from archaeological
            communities in Linked Data. ARIADNE, the AdvancedResearch Infrastructure
            for Archaeological Data set Networking in Europe, facilitates a central
            web portal that providesaccess to archaeological data from various sources.
            Parts of these data have been being published as Linked Data, andare currently
            available in the Linked Open Data cloud. With it, the nature of these
            data has shifted from unstructuredto structured. This presents new opportunities
            for data mining. While general-purpose software exists, recent studieshave
            revealed the importance of two domain-specific requirements: 1) produce
            interpretable results, and 2) allow trustin the underlying model. In this
            work, we investigate to what extend interpretable data mining can contribute
            to theunderstanding of linked archaeological data. A case study washeld,
            which involved the mining of semantic association rules over data sets
            of increasing levels of knowledgegranularity, followed by the qualitative
            evaluation of these rules by domain experts. Experiments have shown that
            theapproach yielded mostly plausible patterns, some of which were seen
            as highly relevant.'

        abstractNote: The Web of Data is an inherently distributed environment where
            ontologies are located in (physically) remote locations and are subject
            to constant changes. Reasoning is affected by these changes, but the extent
            and significance of this dependency is not well-studied yet. To address
            this problem, this paper presents an empirical study on how the distribution
            of ontological data on the Web affects the outcome of reasoning. We study
            (1) to what degree datasets depend on external ontologies and (2) to what
            extent the inclusion of additional ontological information via IRI de-referencing
            and the owl:imports directive to the input datasets leads to new derivations.
            We based our study on many RDF datasets and on a large collection of RDFa,
            and JSON-LD data embedded into HTML pages. We used both Jena and Pellet
            in order to evaluate the results under different semantics. Our results
            indicate that remote ontologies are often crucial to obtain non-trivial
            derivations. Unfortunately, in many cases IRIs were broken and the owl:imports
            is rarely used. Furthermore, in some cases the inclusion of remote knowledge
            either did not yield any additional derivation or led to errors. Despite
            these cases, in general, we found that inclusion of additional ontologies
            via IRIs de-referencing and owl:imports directive is very effective for
            producing new derivations. This indicates that the two W3C standards for
            fetching remote ontologies have found their way into practice.

        abstractNote: It is difficult for software professionals to find all the architectural
            knowledge they need from architecture documentation, and this results
            in wasted time and mistakes in projects.This is the case even when architecture
            documentation is indexed by an ontology and stored in a semantic wiki.We
            present a prototype tool called AK-Finder which queries architectural
            knowledge stored in a semantic wiki as Linked Open Data using a SPARQL
            endpoint.Our tool retrieves knowledge from the semantic wiki and answers
            questions for architectural review, design, and development activities.The
            tool exemplifies how systems used in the software project lifecycle can
            integrate and improve access to architectural knowledge in a semantic
            wiki.

            - in short Kadaster - collects and registers administrative and spatial
            data on property and the rights involved. This includes for ships, aircraft
            and telecommunications networks. Doing so, Kadaster protects legal certainty.
            The Kadaster publishes many large authoritative datasets including several
            key registers of the Dutch Government (Topography, Addresses and Buildings).
            Furthermore Kadaster is also developing and maintaining the PDOK shared
            service, in which about 100 spatial datasets are being published in several
            formats, including an incredible amount of detailed geospatial objects.
            Geospatial objects include all plots of land, all buildings, all roads
            and all lampposts. These objects are spatially and/or conceptually related,
            but are maintained by different data curators. As a result these datasets
            are syntactically and architecturally disjoint, and using them together
            currently requires non-trivial human labor. In response to this, Kadaster
            is currently publishing its geo-spatial data assets as Linked Open Data.
            The standardized query language for Linked Open Geodata is GeoSPARQL.
            Unfortunately, current tooling does not support writing and evaluating
            GeoSPARQL queries. This paper presents GeoYASGUI, a GeoSPARQL editor and
            result-set viewer with IDE capabilities. GeoYASGUI is not a new software
            product, but an integration of and a collection of updates to existing
            Open Source libraries. With GeoYASGUI it becomes possible to query the
            rich Open Data assets of the Kadaster.

            exposes this large collection of data to thousands of daily users that
            operate from within different contexts and that need to be supported in
            different use cases. Therefore, Kadaster must offer diverse, yet complementary,
            approaches for browsing and exploring the data it publishes. Specifically,
            it supports the following paradigms for browsing and exploring its data
            assets: hierarchical browsing, graph navigation, faceted browsing, and
            tabular browsing. These paradigms are useful for different tasks, cover
            different use cases, and are implemented by reusing and/or developing
            Open Source libraries and applications.'

        abstractNote: 'Quality is a complicated and multifarious topic in contemporary
            Linked Data research. The aspect of literal quality in particular has
            not yet been rigorously studied. Nevertheless, analyzing and improving
            the quality of literals is important since literals form a substantial
            (one in seven statements) and crucial part of the Semantic Web. Specifically,
            literals allow infinite value spaces to be expressed and they provide
            the linguistic entry point to the LOD Cloud. We present a toolchain that
            builds on the LOD Laundromat data cleaning and republishing infrastructure
            and that allows us to analyze the quality of literals on a very large
            scale, using a collection of quality criteria we specify in a systematic
            way. We illustrate the viability of our approach by lifting out two particular
            aspects in which the current LOD Cloud can be immediately improved by
            automated means: value canonization and language tagging. Since not all
            quality aspects can be addressed algorithmically, we also give an overview
            of other problems that can be used to guide future endeavors in tooling,
            training, and best practice formulation.'

        abstractNote: 'In modern machine learning, raw data is the pre-ferred input
            for our models. Where a decade ago data sci-entists were still engineering
            features, manually picking out the details they thought salient, they
            now prefer the data as raw as possible. As long as we can assume that
            all relevant and irrelevant information is present in the input data,
            we can design deep models that build up intermediate represen-tations
            to sift out relevant features. In some areas, however, we struggle to
            find this raw form of data. One such area involves heterogeneous knowledge:
            entities, their attributes and internal relations. The Semantic Web community
            has in-vested decades of work on just this problem: how to repre-sent
            knowledge, in various domains, in as raw and as usable a form as possible,
            satisfying many use cases. This work has led to the Linked Open Data Cloud,
            a vast and distributed knowledge graph. If we can develop methods that
            operate on this raw form of data–the knowledge graph–we can dispense with
            a great deal of ad-hoc feature engineering and train deep models end-to-end
            in many more domains. In this position paper, we describe current research
            in this area and discuss some of the promises and challenges of this approach.'
