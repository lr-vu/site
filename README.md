This repo hosts the source code of the website. It's built with Jekyll.
This README is an onboarding document. If you find anything to be updated, including
this README, please make a branch and a pull request (PR). If your Github account is not
added [here](https://github.com/orgs/lr-vu/people), ask people around you to add you.

By building a website with Jekyll and hosting as a Github page, we don't have to worry
about traditional web development. Ideally, we only have to modify markdown files.

Although at the moment some people are more active in the web development, anyone can
make changes / contributions by creating a branch and making a PR to the main
branch. For example, adding / modifying your profile can be easily done by you.

## Prerequisites

1. [Install Ruby, Jekyll, and Bundler](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/)
1. In the root repo directory, install the necessary gems by running `bundle install`.

## Run the website locally

1. Run `bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl /`
1. Type http://127.0.0.1:4000/ on your web browser.
