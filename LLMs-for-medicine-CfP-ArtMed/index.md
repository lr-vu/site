# Special Issue of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine on Large language Models for Medicine

## 1. AIMS AND SCOPE

Large language models (LLMs), trained on extensive datasets encompassing scientific content from numerous disciplines, have demonstrated immense versatility in tasks such as content generation, summarization, translation, prediction, and recognition. With the release of ChatGPT in 2022, there has been a soaring interest in LLMs, and they have already been shown to be surprisingly useful AI tools for a variety of domains and tasks.

LLMs have a great potential to make a positive impact in the medical domain. They can be used in a clinical context both as interactive decision support tools for medical experts, assist in triage processes, enhance symptom collection, and streamline administrative functions like the consolidation of patient notes and discharge documents. In the education of doctors, LLMs can be utilized in preparing learning materials, supporting interactive learning and aid in the assessment of medical knowledge. Moreover, for medical researchers, LLMs offer the advantage of easy access to relevant literature, efficient knowledge summaries, and support during manuscript drafting.

At the same time, the medical domain poses more difficult challenges to LLMs than many other domains. Medicine is a mission critical domain in which inaccuracies can have disastrous consequences. Hence, the demands for precision, comprehensiveness, up-to-date information, and clarity are considerably heightened in this field. Added layers of complexity arise from the stringent privacy norms and the extensive legal frameworks that heavily regulate the medical sector

To embrace the challenges and opportunities in designing, validating and deploying LLMs in a medical context, this special issue aims to encourage submissions of scientific findings from both academia and healthcare industry that present fundamental theory, techniques, practical experiences of LLMs in medicine as well as roadmaps for directions of research and development.

*This special issue seeks scientific papers that contain novelty from an AI perspective. Papers that simply apply existing algorithms and systems to a medical domain are outside the scope of the issue and will be bench rejected.*

## 2. TOPICS COVERED

The topics of this special issue include, but are not limited to:
- Novel text resources for training clinical LLMs
- Translating doctor-to-patient language
- Training and refining LLMs for medical education
- Training and refining LLMs for medical research
- Local language models
- Combining LLMs and medical knowledge graphs
- Accuracy and recency of LLMs for medical applications
- New evaluation paradigms for medical LLMs
- Explanations of LLMs for medical applications
- Addressing multi-linguality requirements in clinical LLMs
- Real-time Web access for medical LLMs
- Addressing bias in medical LLMs
- Ethical and legal aspects of medical LLMs

We encourage authors to publish training data and models on platforms such as at Hugging Face or Github.
