**Two Research Assistant positions to develop AI for sustainability**

This project is funded by a seed grant from the Amsterdam Sustainability Institute (ASI) for interdisciplinary research on supporting sustainable diet policies by knowledge-based AI. Its objectives are twofold: (1) to collect and consolidate information on food production, composition, supply chains, recycling, etc. into a comprehensive knowledge base for studying sustainable diet policies; and (2) to present the data to end users, using a tiered approach to first show summarized information, with possibility for further exploration and simulation of causal impact of policy interventions. This project will be supervised by Filip Ilievski (assistant professor with expertise in AI from L\&R) and Reinout Heijungs (professor with expertise in life cycle analytics in the Department of Operations Analytics, within the School of Business and Economics).

To make this project a success, we are looking for two research assistants (RAs) with strong technical skills and an affinity with the topic of sustainability. Key technical skills are programming in Python, natural language processing tools, and information crawling and extraction tools. Experience in application development is a plus. The RAs will work jointly on the two objectives of developing a comprehensive knowledge base and a corresponding analytical interface. Each RA is planned to be employed for 5.5 months for 8 hours per week. There is no strict deadline for this application, though we anticipate that the starting date of the project in March or April. To apply, please send via email to [Filip Ilievski](https://www.ilievski.info) (<f.ilievski@vu.nl>):
