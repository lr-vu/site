# Get in touch

Feel free to get in touch with us on any subject. Whether you want to give us some feedback, talk to us about our research, or propose a collaboration, we want to hear from you. The best way to do this is to find the <a href="/about/people">specific group member</a>, whose work is closest to what you want to discuss. When in doubt, just pick a faculty member, and they'll redirect you to the right person. 

If you are interested in working with us, please check the <a href="/about/jobs">jobs
page</a>. If there is nothing there, we do not currently offer any new positions. This includes PhD positions, which are posted as job openings in the Netherlands. For jobs anywhere in our department or at our university, have a look at [the university job listings page](https://workingat.vu.nl/home).

For general enquiries, send an email to the department secretary <a href="mailto:m.lovrencak@vu.nl">Mojca Lovrenƒçak</a>.
    
# For students

If you are a student looking for thesis supervision, you should have access to an overview of projects available at the department on Canvas. Do not approach researchers before checking the list to see if they have projects or slots available. If you have trouble finding a supervisor, contact the coordinator for your thesis project. You can find [an overview of thesis topics we offer in the group here](https://cutt.ly/NwmLzD7H
).
